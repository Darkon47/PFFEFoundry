Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/npc-classes/non-player-characters\">Creating NPCs</a>). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort’s alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a –1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.</p>\n<div>\n<p>A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP. Instead, divide the cohort’s level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort’s total.</p>\n<p>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Followers by Level</strong>: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they’re generally low-level NPCs. Because they’re usually 5 or more levels behind you, they’re rarely effective in combat.</p>\n<p>Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult&nbsp;Table: Leadership&nbsp;to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"CRB","activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"contextNotes":[],"featType":"feat","requirements":"General","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false,"_deprecated":true},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":10000000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_08.jpg","_id":"dQPOow0zCPPQsT0R"}
