Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a&nbsp;full-round action&nbsp;that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.</p>"
