The unique shape and craft of these bows allows them to shoot with the same velocity and power as a longbow. The shorter size also allows them to be wielded easily while mounted on horseback (or atop any other steed). While mounted, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls with a reflex bow. All reflex bows are composite bows and can be modified to benefit from high Strength scores in the same way as composite bows. Effects that apply to both longbows and shortbows also apply to reflex bows.</p>"
