A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate, and takes a -4 penalty on both attacks.</p>\n<p>A double shot that fires bullets targets only a single creature and increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small) or 2d8 points (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A doublebarreled shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an advanced firearm.</strong></p>"
