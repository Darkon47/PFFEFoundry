As such, it can take a variety of different forms, from wildly ornate masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to the more common woodhandled pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal tube with a triggering device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an early firearm.</strong></p>"
