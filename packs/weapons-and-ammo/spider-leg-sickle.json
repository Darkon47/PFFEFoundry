It has the same statistics as a normal sickle and can trip opponents, but deals piercing damage rather than slashing damage. The leatherwrapped handle contains a hollow recess that can hold a single dose of poison. Filling the reservoir is a full-round action that carries the usual risks of poisoning yourself. Once filled, the reservoir keeps the blade saturated and viable for up to 2 hours. The first successful attack made with the spider-leg sickle during this time administers and expends the dose of poison. Mog-Lathar's deacons carry masterwork versions of these weapons. The cult uses blue whinnis poison, and within the radius of the <em>dreamstone</em>'s effects the unconsciousness effect may trigger lucid dreaming.</p>"
