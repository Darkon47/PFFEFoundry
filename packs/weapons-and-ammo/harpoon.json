Most harpoons have metal points, but some use ivory or are made entirely of wood. If you are proficient with the harpoon, it is a grappling weapon. A harpoon's weight includes 10 pounds for the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope. The weight can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope. If you are not proficient with a harpoon, treat it like a spear.</p>"
