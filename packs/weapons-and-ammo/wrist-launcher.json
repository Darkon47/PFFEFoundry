The launcher functions by means of a tightly compressed spring, and must be reloaded and re-cocked with a separate ramrod as a full-round action. After firing, the wearer can attempt a Sleight of Hand check opposed by opponents' Perception checks to keep the wrist launcher concealed. If you are proficient with hand crossbows, you are also proficient with wrist launchers. </p>"
