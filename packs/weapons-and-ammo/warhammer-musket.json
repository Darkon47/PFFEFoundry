It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon.</p>\n<p>If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the warhammer are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an early firearm.</strong></p>"
