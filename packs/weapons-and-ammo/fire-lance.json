Unlike other firearms, the fire lance is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. A fire lance uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an early firearm.</strong></p>"
