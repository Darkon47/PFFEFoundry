It is similar to the advanced firearms rif le with the following differences. It uses the same 7.62 54mmR ammunition as the Madsen machine gun, and is fed from a 5-round internal, nondetachable magazine that is typically loaded with 5-round stripper clips (loading it is a move action).</p>\n<p>Without stripper clips, you may only reload up to 2 rounds of ammunition as a move action. Ammunition is typically sold in groups of 5 rounds.</p>\n<p>The rifle has a lug for the attachment of a socket bayonet, and can be equipped with a unique sidemount scope system (see below).</p>"
