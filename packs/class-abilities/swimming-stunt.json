If the attack and Swim check are both successful, and the attack deals sneak attack damage, the rogue can choose to forgo one or more of her sneak attack dice to reduce the number of total rounds her opponent can hold its breath by 1 round per die. A rogue must be trained in Swim to select this talent.</p>"
