A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round. The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigatorâ€™s level + his Intelligence modifier. This talent has no effect on deaf creatures. Deafness can be cured by&nbsp;heal,&nbsp;regeneration,&nbsp;remove blindness, or similar effects.</p>\n<p>An investigator must be at least 15th level to select this talent.</p>"
