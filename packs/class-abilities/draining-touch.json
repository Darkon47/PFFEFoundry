If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier) or take 1d2 points of Charisma damage. If a creature is affected, the colors of its skin, hair, and eyes dull and become less vibrant.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this power again for 24 hours. You regain 1 point in your phrenic pool each time you successfully drain a creature this way.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>"
