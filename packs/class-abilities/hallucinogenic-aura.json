      "value": "<p>At 13th level, a mental field emanates from you, touching the minds of those nearby. Any creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your hallucinogenic aura for 24 hours. A creature that fails its save doesn’t need to continue making saves while it’s confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>You’re immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. One dose’s effects last for 1 month.</p>"
