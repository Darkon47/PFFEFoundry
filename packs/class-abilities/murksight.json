If the effect is created by magic, the witch can see up to 15 feet without penalty, with normal penalties and effects applying beyond that distance.</p>\n<p>This ability functions underwater as well, allowing the witch to see in murky water as though it were clear.</p>\n<p>This does not allow the witch to see anything she could not see otherwise, such as an invisible creature.</p>"
