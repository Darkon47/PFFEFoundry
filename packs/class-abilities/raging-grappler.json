As long as she is raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a check to start a grapple, she can choose to deal damage as if she had also succeeded at a check to maintain the grapple. In addition, while she is raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple, she can choose to give herself, the target of her grapple, or both the prone condition as a free action while continuing to maintain the grapple.</p>"
