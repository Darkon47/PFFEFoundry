      "value": "<p>At 15th level, the cavalier can utilize the power of his spellcasting allies to make devastating attacks against the allies’ targets. If the cavalier is adjacent to an enemy affected by a targeted or area spell or spell-like ability cast by one of the cavalier’s allies, he can make an immediate attack of opportunity against the affected creature. If the cavalier is also affected by the spell (such as by being caught in the area of the same @Compendium[pf1.spells.6oq1wcryviik9ice]{Fireball}&nbsp;spell), during the rest of that round he automatically confirms any critical hits made against the affected creature while using this ability.</p>"
