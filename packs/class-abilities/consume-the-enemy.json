      "value": "<p>As a full-round action that is considered an evil act and provokes attacks of opportunity, you can bite a helpless living or freshly killed creature, dealing 1d3 points of damage. By consuming the creatureâ€™s flesh, you gain a +1 profane bonus on saving throw DCs for all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities you use against creatures of the same type (and subtype, if humanoid or outsider) as the cannibalized creature. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 your cleric level or until you use this ability against a different creature. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, this bonus increases by 1 (+5 maximum). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Touch of Evil power of the Evil Domain.</p>"
