This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing her to move up to 10 feet per arcanist level to any location she can see. This counts as 5 feet of movement.</p>\n<p>She can only use this ability once per round.</p>\n<p>She does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement she attempts as part of her move action provokes as normal.</p>"
