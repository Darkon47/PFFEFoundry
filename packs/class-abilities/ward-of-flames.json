The next time the warded creature is struck with a melee attack, the creature making the attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not already expended.</p>\n<p>At 8th and 16th levels, the ward lasts for one additional attack.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>"
