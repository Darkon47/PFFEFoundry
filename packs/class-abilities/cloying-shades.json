      "value": "<p>When a rogue with this talent uses&nbsp;dimension door&nbsp;as a spell or spell-like ability, including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature, then all creatures adjacent to the rogue at the start and end of her teleportation are entangled by grasping shadows for 1 round (although the creatures are not anchored in place). A successful Reflex saving throw negates this effect. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). The rogue must have&nbsp;dimension door&nbsp;as a spell or spell-like ability (including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature) before choosing this talent.</p>"
