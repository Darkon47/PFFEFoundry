      "value": "<p>Once per day as a standard action, you can cause the weapons around you to shatter in their wielders’ hands. When you use this ability, attempt a single sunder combat maneuver, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your Charisma modifier in place of Strength. Every creature except you in a 10-foot radius that is wielding a manufactured weapon is targeted by the same attempt. You deal an amount of damage to each weapon affected equal to 1d4 × your Charisma modifier (minimum 1d4). At 11th level, this damage increases to 1d6 × your Charisma modifier (minimum 1d6).</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</p>"
