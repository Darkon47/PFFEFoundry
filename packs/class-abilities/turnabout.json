Whenever a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the vigilante by attacking or casting a spell, the vigilante can attempt a dirty trick&nbsp;combat maneuver check in place of the attack of opportunity. If he succeeds at the check, in addition to the usual options, the vigilante can redirect the attack or spell to a new target or area the foe could have chosen.</p>"
