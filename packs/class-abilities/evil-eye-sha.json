The target takes a –2 penalty on one of the following (shaman’s choice): ability checks, AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces this to just 1 round.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the penalty increases to –4. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>"
