Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite attack, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, the target is knocked prone. If the eidolon fails, it is not tripped in return.</p>\n<p>This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon.&nbsp;</p>"
