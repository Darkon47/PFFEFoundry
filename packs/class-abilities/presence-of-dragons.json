As a swift action, you can manifest an aura of draconic might around yourself. Enemies within 30 feet who can see you when you activate this ability must attempt a Will save. Success means that the creature is immune to this ability for the following 24 hours. On a failed save, the opponent is shaken for 2d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th.</p>"
