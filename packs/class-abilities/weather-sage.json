The arcanistâ€™s prediction is always accurate, but it cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter conditions. In addition, she gains a bonus equal to half her arcanist level on Fortitude saves against severe weather for the next 24 hours. She can share this benefit with a number of allies equal to her Charisma bonus.</p>"
