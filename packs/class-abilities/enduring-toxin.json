Altering a dose of poison in the way takes 1 hour, requires the expenditure of raw materials worth half the poison’s market price, and exposes the alchemist to the poison, thereby affecting him if he is not immune. This doubles the poison’s maximum duration.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
