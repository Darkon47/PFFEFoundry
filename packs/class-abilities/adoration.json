      "value": "<p>As an immediate action, you can attempt to thwart a melee or ranged attack that targets you. This ability functions as&nbsp;sanctuary, but only against one individual attack. You must use the ability after the attack is declared but before the roll is made. The creature attacking you receives a Will save to negate this effect. If a creature has more than one attack, this ability only affects one of the attacks. You can use the ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Dazing Touch power of the Charm Domain.</p>"
