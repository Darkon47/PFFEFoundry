      "value": "<p>At 15th level, you can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water, with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-\">burrow</a>&nbsp;speed equal to half your normal speed. You do not leave a tunnel or trace of your passage. You can use this ability for 1 minute per sorcerer level each day. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>"
