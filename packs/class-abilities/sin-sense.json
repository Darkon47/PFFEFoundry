Once you learn this fact, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Charisma-based skill check made against the target as long as it somehow incorporates a temptation that relates to that sin. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. This is a mindaffecting effect.</p>"
