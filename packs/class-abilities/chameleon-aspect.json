While under the effect of this power, you gain concealment from creatures more than 10 feet away (attacks have a 20% miss chance), and total concealment from creatures more than 40 feet away (attacks have a 50% miss chance). You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Copycat power of the Trickery Domain.</p>"
