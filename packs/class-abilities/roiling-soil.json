      "value": "<p>Combining your mastery of earth and water, you shape the battlefield in your favor, bending the terrain to benefit you and your allies and hinder any who might oppose you. The ground within 5 feet per 2 oracle levels you have shifts and rolls unpredictably; if you use this ability underwater, the surrounding waters churn. This area moves with you, and you and your allies are unaffected by the roiling terrain. Other creatures can move within the area at half speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means they stop moving for the round, while failure by 5 or more causes them to fall prone; if underwater, creatures gain the effects of being off-balance (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&nbsp;433) instead of falling prone.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your oracle level, and you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
