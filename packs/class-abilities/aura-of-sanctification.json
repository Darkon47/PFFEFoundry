These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Within this aura, effects that are specifically harmful to good-aligned creatures are inverted so that they no longer harm good creatures and instead harm evil creatures. Similarly, effects that are specifically beneficial to evil creatures instead become beneficial only to good creatures.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Holy Lance power of the Good Domain</p>"
