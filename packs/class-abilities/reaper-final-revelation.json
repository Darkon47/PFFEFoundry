You automatically confirm critical hits and creatures automatically fail Fortitude saves against your coup de grace attempts. In addition, you can notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if you had the blindsense ability. This sense does not allow you to detect objects, but it does allow you to notice living things that are not creatures.</p>"
