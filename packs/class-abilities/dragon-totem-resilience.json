This resistance equals double her current DR/— from her barbarian damage reduction class feature; this DR increases by 2 for each dragon totem rage power she possesses, including this one.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must have the dragon totem rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p>"
