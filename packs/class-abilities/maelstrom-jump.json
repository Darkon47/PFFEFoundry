She can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a swift action to gain the benefits of @Compendium[pf1.spells.ja005kj1gh7g0dnk]{Entropic Shield}&nbsp;for 1 minute and move 10 feet in a random direction. For the next minute, she moves 10 feet in a random direction at the end of each of her turns. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity or count against her movement for the round. If the movement would end her movement in an occupied space, she instead travels to the nearest unoccupied space.</p>"
