      "value": "<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, you can share your vital energy with a living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;+ 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot take an amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;equal to or greater than your current hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>&nbsp;equal to the amount of damage you received (prevented damage is not counted). These&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>&nbsp;disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. This ability has no effect if you are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>.</p>"
