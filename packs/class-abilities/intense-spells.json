      "value": "<p>Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add 1/2 your wizard level to the damage (minimum +1). This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. This bonus damage is not increased by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/empower-spell-metamagic\">Empower Spell</a>&nbsp;or similar effects. This damage is of the same type as the spell. At 20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll twice to penetrate a creatureâ€™s spell resistance and take the better result.</p>"
