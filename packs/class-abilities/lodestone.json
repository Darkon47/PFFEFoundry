      "value": "<p>The shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to become heavy and lethargic. The creature is treated as if it were carrying a medium load (see Table 7–5 of the&nbsp;Core Rulebook). If the creature is already carrying a medium load, it is instead treated as if it were carrying a heavy load. If the creature is carrying a heavy load, its maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is reduced to +0, it takes a –9 armor check penalty, and its movement is reduced to 5 feet. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>"
