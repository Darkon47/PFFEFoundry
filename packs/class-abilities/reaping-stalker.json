A slayer with this talent treats any sickle or scythe he wields as though it were one size larger for the purpose of determining its damage dice. In addition, the slayer increases the critical threat range of any sickle or scythe he wields by 1; this does not stack with other effects that alter a weaponâ€™s threat range.</p>"
