The storm has a range of 100 feet and is a 20-foot-radius burst. Objects and creatures in the area take 1d8 hit points of damage for every two oracle levels you possess. Undead creatures in the area take 1d8 points of damage for every oracle level you possess. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to half.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>"
