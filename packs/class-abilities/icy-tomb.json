      "value": "<p>Whenever the arcanist uses the ice missile exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target is coated in rime if it fails its saving throw. As long as the ice remains (typically 1 minute per level in a warm area), the target is entangled (although not anchored) and takes 1 point of Dexterity damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can break free from the ice as a standard action by making a Strength check with a DC equal to 10 + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier. If the target takes more than 10 points of fire damage from a single attack, the ice melts and the effect ends.</p>\n<p>The arcanist must have the ice missile arcanist exploit to select this exploit.</p>"
