Whenever you cast a spell, you can choose to trigger a primal magic event in addition to casting the spell itself—you can use this ability once per minute. If your spellcasting causes a primal magic event to occur, your spell effect is not replaced by the primal magic event—it takes place normally, along with the event itself.</p>"
