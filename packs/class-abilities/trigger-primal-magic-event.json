      "value": "<p>Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause a spellcaster (including yourself ) within 30 feet to trigger a primal magic event as the spell is being cast.</p>\n<p>At 13th level, you can cause any creature in the act of activating a magic item to trigger a primal magic event (see page 13).</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. A spellcaster can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spellâ€™s level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect, but non-spellcasters activating magic items have no such option.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 9th level before selecting this revelation.</p>"
