      "value": "<p>The witch can conjure a large lotus flower that floats by her side for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration doesnâ€™t need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. While summoned, the witch can use the lotus to cross water as if she was affected by @Compendium[pf1.spells.g2obld7y0lpyztes]{Water Walk}. She can also use the flower for short bursts of flight, gaining a +10 enhancement bonus on Acrobatics checks when attempting high jumps and long jumps.</p>\n<p>This bonus increases by 10 at 5th level, and again at 9th level.</p>"
