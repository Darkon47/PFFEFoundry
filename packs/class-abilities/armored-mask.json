She gains the benefits of @Compendium[pf1.spells.ucc0a31d1y86oleh]{Mage Armor}&nbsp;with a caster level thatâ€™s equal to her arcanist level and appears to be wearing light or medium armor of whatever design she chooses when activating this ability. At any time while this effect is active, she can expend 1 additional point from her arcane reservoir as an immediate action to also gain the benefits of @Compendium[pf1.spells.y2uhoqr4itdbw5g4]{Shield Of Faith}&nbsp;with a caster level equal to her arcanist level.</p>"
