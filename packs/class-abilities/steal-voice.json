      "value": "<p>The witch can steal the voice of one creature within 30 feet, causing it to lose, for a number of rounds equal to the witch’s Intelligence bonus, all abilities that rely on speech, including talking, casting spells with verbal components, and using auditory bardic performances. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. If this hex is used upon a willing target, the duration lasts for a number of hours equal to the witch’s Intelligence bonus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the witch can change her voice to match that of any creature whose voice she has stolen with this hex, as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.26g4tysnax570dxo]{Vocal Alteration} (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 248).</p>"
