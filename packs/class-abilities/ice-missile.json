      "value": "<p>The arcanist can unleash a freezing projectile by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of cold damage + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of cold damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). In addition, the target is staggered for 1 round. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the staggered condition.</p>"
