In addition, as a standard action, she can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode from her body in a 10-foot-radius burst. This deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2 shaman levels she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage.</p>\n<p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.</p>"
