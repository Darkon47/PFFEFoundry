      "value": "<p>As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can irradiate any unattended object for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. While an object is irradiated, it emits a faint aura of transmutation. Any creature that passes within 5 feet of the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier) or become sickened. You’re immune to this object’s effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Acid Dart power of the Earth Domain.</p>"
