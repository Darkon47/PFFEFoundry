      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot-radius aura of chaos and strife for 1 round per cleric level. Enemies in the aura take a â€“4 penalty on concentration checks and are treated as experiencing vigorous motion (concentration DC = 10 + spell level) when attempting to cast spells. This penalty increases by 1 for every 2 cleric levels you have beyond 8th. This is a mind-affecting effect. These rounds need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Chaos Blade power of the Chaos Domain.</p>"
