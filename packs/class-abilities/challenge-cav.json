The cavalier&rsquo;s melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p>The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>"
