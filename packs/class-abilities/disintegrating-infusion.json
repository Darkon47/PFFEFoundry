Against creatures, your kinetic blast deals double its normal amount of damage, but targets receive a saving throw to reduce the damage to half the blast’s normal amount of damage (for a total of 1/4 of the blast’s increased damage). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the blast is disintegrated, as the spell&nbsp;disintegrate.</p>\n<p>You can use the infused blast to destroy force effects or objects as&nbsp;disintegrate, but for each force effect or 10-foot cube of nonliving matter you destroy in this way, you must accept 1 point of burn, which can’t be reduced by effects such as infusion specialization or gather power.</p>"
