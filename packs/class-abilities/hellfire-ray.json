      "value": "<p>When an arcanist uses the flame arc exploit, she can spend 1 additional point from her arcane reservoir to draw the flames from Hell. If she does so, half of the damage she deals is fire, and the other half results directly from unholy power that is not subject to fire resistance. Good creatures that take damage from a hellfire ray must succeed at a Will saving throw or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.</p>"
