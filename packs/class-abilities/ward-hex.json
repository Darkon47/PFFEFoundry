This ward lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A witch can have only one ward active at a time. If the witch uses this ability again, the previous ward immediately ends.</p>\n<p>A witch cannot use this ability on herself.</p>\n<p>At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by +1.</p>"
