The opponent takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels they possess and is pushed 5 feet directly away from the shaman. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, any melee weapon she wields is treated as if it had the&nbsp;quenching&nbsp;weapon special ability.</p>"
