She is never slowed by such effects, and she doesnâ€™t need to attempt Acrobatics skill checks to move across such surfaces. She can also move through magical environmental effects that she created.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, the shaman can see twice as far as normal through environmental effects, whether or not they are magical in nature.</p>"
