Pick one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The eidolon gains resist 5 against that energy type.</p>\n<p>This resistance increases by 5 for every 5 levels the summoner possesses, to a maximum of 15 at 10th level.</p>\n<p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different energy type.</p>"
