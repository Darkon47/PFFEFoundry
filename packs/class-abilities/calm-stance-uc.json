While in this stance, the barbarian doesn’t gain any benefits from rage other than the temporary hit points, but she doesn’t take any of the penalties from rage (including the penalty to AC and the restriction on actions she can take). Rounds spent in a calm stance still count against her total number of rounds of rage per day.</p>\n<p>This is a stance rage power.</p>"
