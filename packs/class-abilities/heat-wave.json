Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the heat aura as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around you rises by 5° F per kineticist level you possess, to a maximum modified temperature of 120° F. If this brings the temperature to at least 90° F, all attacks made by creatures within 5 feet of you suffer a 20% miss chance due to concealment. You are immune to these effects, as are those immune to fire or benefiting from&nbsp;endure elements.</p>"
