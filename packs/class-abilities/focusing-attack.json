When the rogue has the selected condition and hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue no longer has that condition. A rogue can take this talent up to three times. Each time, she must select a different condition that she is able to remove from herself with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage. Even if the rogue has taken this talent multiple times, she can remove only a single effect on herself with each melee attack that deals sneak attack damage.</p>"
