In addition, when within an area of darkness or dim light, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;you may choose to switch places with a willing ally within 60 feet, who must also be in darkness or dim light. At 13th level, you can instead switch the positions of two willing allies, each of whom must be within 60 feet of you. Unless otherwise noted, this travel is identical to @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension Door}. You may use the ability to switch places once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at 17th level and 20th level.</p>"
