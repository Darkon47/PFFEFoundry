In addition, this performance removes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened\">sickened</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken\">shaken</a>&nbsp;condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
