      "value": "<p>At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, you can impose either starvation or thirst upon a living creature you can see within 30 feet. This requires the creature to make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;check each round (DC 10 + 1 for each previous check) to avoid taking 1d6 points of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>. The creature must continue to make these checks until, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, it quenches its thirst or sates its hunger (see starvation and thirst). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier, but can only apply it once every 24 hours to any given creature. Creatures that do not need to eat are immune to this effect.</p>"
