In addition, when an investigator creates an anathema, he can designate a specific kind of creature (such as vampires) in addition to the creature type. When used against this specific foe, the DC of the save against the anathema is 2 higher than the component poison.</p>\n<p>An investigator must have the anathema investigator talent to select this talent.</p>"
