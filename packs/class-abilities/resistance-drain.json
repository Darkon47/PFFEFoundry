If she does so, she adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell. These points are temporary and are lost after 1 minute unless used. Points gained in excess of her arcane reservoirâ€™s maximum are lost.</p>\n<p>The arcanist must have the greater spell resistance exploit to select this exploit.</p>"
