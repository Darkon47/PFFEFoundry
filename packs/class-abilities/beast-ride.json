While you are possessing an animal in this way, your own body becomes helpless and unaware. You can travel any distance from your body so long as you remain on the same plane, and can return to your own body as a free action at any time. If the animal or your body takes damage, or you attempt to make the animal attack or do anything out of character, the effect immediately ends and you return to your own body.</p>"
