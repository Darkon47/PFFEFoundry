You can cause the weapon to be treated as cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction for 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can touch an additional weapon as part of using this ability to grant that weapon the same benefit (still expending only 1 point of mental focus).</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you can cause any weapon affected by this ability to act as if it were adamantine instead (but only for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, not for overcoming hardness).</p>"
