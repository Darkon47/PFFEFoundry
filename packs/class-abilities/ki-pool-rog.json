This&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool is similar to a ninja’s&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, but the rogue’s&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool does not grant any extra attacks. The rogue gains a number of&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). These&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points replenish at the start of each day. If she already has a&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, or gains a&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool later, she gains half her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1) as bonus&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points to her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. She can spend a&nbsp;ki&nbsp;point to gain a +10-foot bonus to movement until the end of her turn.</p>"
