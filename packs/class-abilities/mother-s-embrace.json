When you would fail a Will save, you can add 1d4 to your result; whether or not this causes you to succeed at the saving throw, you take 2 points of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<p>When you perform an act of cruelty, you regain 1 phrenic pool point. You can use each aspect of this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>"
