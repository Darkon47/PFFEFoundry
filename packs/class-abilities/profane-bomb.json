Good creatures that take a direct hit from a profane bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against a neutral creature, a profane bomb deals half damage, and the target is not affected by the bombâ€™s staggering effect. A profane bomb has no effect against evil-aligned creatures.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.</p>"
