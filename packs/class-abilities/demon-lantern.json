      "value": "<p>Once per day when she casts&nbsp;dancing lights, the rogue can conjure a single demon’s lantern instead of the usual four lights. A demon lantern acts in all ways as a&nbsp;hypnotic pattern&nbsp;spell cast by a wizard, except it also casts light as a torch and it fascinates only a single target whose Hit Dice do not exceed the rogue’s class level. The save DC of this effect is equal to 11 + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier. The rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 11 to select this talent. A rogue must have selected the minor magic rogue talent and selected&nbsp;dancing lights&nbsp;as her spell of choice or otherwise be able to cast&nbsp;dancing lights&nbsp;before choosing this talent.</p>"
