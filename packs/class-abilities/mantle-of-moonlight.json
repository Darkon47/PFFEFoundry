This action automatically forces the lycanthrope into its humanoid form, which it must remain in for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Upon reaching 5th level, you can use this ability to force others into a&nbsp;rage, as per the spell. Using this ability is a melee touch attack.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day at 5th level plus one additional time per day for every 5 levels above 5th.</p>"
