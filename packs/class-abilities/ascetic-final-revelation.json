      "value": "<p>At 20th level, you become a magical creature. You are forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever your creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, you gain damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows you to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type.</p>"
