Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute. This is a light effect.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
