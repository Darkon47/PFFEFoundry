The damage dealt by the attack becomes nonlethal damage, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the samurai’s class level + her Charisma modifier) or be charmed as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.smbkd2yobhshbpqf]{Charm Monster}&nbsp;(caster level equals the samurai’s class level).</p>"
