When she uses this ability, she can tell whether or not creatures within 30 feet of her that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or dead. She can also tell if those creatures are confused, disabled, diseased, nauseated, poisoned sickened or staggered.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, when using life sight she is able to sense all nearby living creatures; this functions similar to blindsight, but only for living creatures within 30 feet of her.</p>\n<p>The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to consecutive.</p>"
