      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you dance, act like a buffoon, or commit some other act of whimsy. When you do, enemies within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you must succeed a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + half your Wisdom modifier) or they collapse into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. Those who fail their saving throws can take no actions other than laughing for 1 round, but are not considered helpless. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time for every 4 levels you possess beyond 8th.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Chaos Blade power of the Chaos Domain.</p>"
