All creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or take a penalty on attack rolls, saves against fear effects, and skill checks for 1d4 minutes. The penalty is equal to (but doesn’t stack with) the penalty provided by your despair ability. The DC of the saving throw equals 10 + half your psychic level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>You’re immune to your own wave of gloom. This is a mind-affecting emotion&nbsp;effect.</p>"
