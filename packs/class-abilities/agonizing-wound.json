If you expend two uses of this ability, you can instead have the creature become dazed, nauseated, or panicked for 1 round. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>"
