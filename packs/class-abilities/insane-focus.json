This bonus lasts for 1 minute. If the creature fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect during this period, it loses its immunity to confusion and is immediately confused for one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Visions of Madness power of the Madness Domain.</p>"
