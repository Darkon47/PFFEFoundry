The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be cursed. Select one of the following effects: the target takes a –2 penalty to one ability score of your choice (the ability cannot be reduced below 1); the target takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; each turn, the target has a 25% chance of taking no action (otherwise, it acts normally). This curse lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>A creature can be subjected to only one instance of retributive curse at a time. This otherwise functions as&nbsp;bestow curse.</p>"
