      "value": "<p>As a swift action, you can manifest a set of translucent, inky wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you can use these wings to fly as if with @Compendium[pf1.spells.wqvy12w1xgk6l9b0]{Overland Flight} once per day. Used in this way, the ability lasts for up to 1 hour per level, and counts as your total use of this ability for the day.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
