This includes the damage dealt by the successful attack as well as the additional damage from the studied strike. He can expend a use of inspiration to use this ability a second time per day. Using this ability doesn’t require an action.</p>\n<p>The investigator must have the numerical strike talent and be at least 13th level to select this talent.</p>"
