As a standard action, he can shout orders that grant all allies within 60 feet a competence bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, and Survival checks while they are in this terrain for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 his cavalier level. At 12th level and every four levels thereafter, the cavalier may select a new terrain type that this ability can affect.</p>"
