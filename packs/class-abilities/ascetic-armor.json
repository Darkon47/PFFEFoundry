These techniques grant you a +4 armor bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2.</p>\n<p>At 13th level, the techniques also grant DR 5/unarmed strikes or natural attacks. You can gain the benefits of ascetic armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. The hours do not need to be consecutive, but you must spend them in 1-hour increments.</p>"
