      "value": "<p>The alchemist creates an inhaled version of an extract that is shared among multiple creatures. He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemistâ€™s daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
