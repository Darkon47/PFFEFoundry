If she chooses to move a portion of the fire, it must be moved to a square contiguous with that fire. If she also expends a spell slot of at least 3rd level when activating this ability, she can attempt to dispel a magical fire effect, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic}.</p>"
