      "value": "<p>The witch fills an ally with the safety he feels at home or inflicts pangs of homesickness to hamper an enemy’s defenses. She chooses a target for the hex within 30 feet. If she chooses an ally, that ally gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. If she chooses an opponent, that opponent takes a –2 penalty to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. Either way, the effects last for 1 minute. The target can attempt a Will save to negate the effects of the hex.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 4.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 6.</p>\n<p>A creature targeted by this hex cannot be targeted again by this hex for 1 day.</p>"
