Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by&nbsp;restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, this functions as&nbsp;resurrection&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>"
