Once per round, she can have one of her attacks deal an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/2 her bonus damage from powerful stance. This bleed damage bypasses damage reduction. This bleed damage doesnâ€™t stack with itself.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must have the powerful stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>"
