      "value": "<p>When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can apply a dose of contact or injury poison to it, as if applying poison to a weapon. If the poisoned bomb hits its target, the bomb deals damage as normal, but the target must also succeed at a saving throw against the poison or be affected by that poison. No other creatures are affected by the poison.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level and have the poison use class feature before selecting this discovery.</p>"
