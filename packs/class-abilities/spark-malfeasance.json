      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can awaken the sinful desires of a target within 30 feet with a ranged touch attack. The target suffers extreme guilt and is sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level. To end the effect earlier, the target can willingly commit an evil act (if it is of good alignment) or attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier) at the beginning of its turn each round. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are immune to this ability for 24 hours. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 8th.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Scythe of Evil power of the Evil Domain.</p>"
