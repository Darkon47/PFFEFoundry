As a standard action, one target within 30 feet is wreathed in screaming flames and takes 1d6 points of fire damage per level. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, the fireâ€™s howls cause any creatures damaged by it to be staggered for 1 round.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, creatures who fail their saves against the balefire are staggered for 1d4 rounds and stunned for 1 round.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day at 10th level.</p>"
