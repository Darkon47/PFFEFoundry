This special action doesnâ€™t combine with sudden attack, but works as normal with effects such as&nbsp;haste&nbsp;and two-weapon fighting. As soon as you begin moving, you are considered to have begun the full-round action, even if circumstances prevent you from attacking at the end of your movement.</p>"
