      "value": "<p>The arcanist can unleash a jet of holy water by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This creates a 30-foot line of water that deals damage equal to 1d8 points of damage plus the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d8 points of damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d8 at 19th level) to each target in the line that would normally take damage from holy water. Creatures in the area of effect can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage.</p>"
