As an attack action, the slayer can make a single melee attack against his studied target at his highest base attack bonus. When attempting a swallow reversal, the slayer rolls two attack rolls and uses the highest result. If the attack is a critical threat, the slayer attempts to confirm the critical hit as normal.</p>\n<p>The slayer can use swallow reversal at will, but it can only be used against a given target once per day.</p>"
