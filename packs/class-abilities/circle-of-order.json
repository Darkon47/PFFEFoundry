This grants him a dodge bonus to his AC equal to half his magus level (maximum +10 at 20th level) against chaotic-aligned attacks and effects and outsiders with the chaotic subtype until the beginning of his next turn. (For example, the magus would gain the dodge bonus against attacks from an&nbsp;anarchic&nbsp;weapon or a glabrezuâ€™s pincers.)</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 9th level to select this arcana.</p>"
