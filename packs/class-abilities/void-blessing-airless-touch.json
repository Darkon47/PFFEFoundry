      "value": "<p>At 1st level, with a successful melee touch attack you can steal the breath from an opponent’s lungs, leaving it unable to speak, use breath weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else requiring breath for 1 round. If the target fails at a Fortitude saving throw, it’s also staggered for 1 round as it catches its breath. If the target was attempting to hold its breath, it can no longer do so: it must breathe on its turn or risk suffocation and unconsciousness.</p>\n<p>Creatures that don’t need to breathe are unaffected.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether it succeeds at its saving throw, the target is immune to further uses of your airless touch for 24 hours.</p>"
