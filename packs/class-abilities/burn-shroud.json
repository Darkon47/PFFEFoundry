      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can make an unarmed touch attack against a creature. The target takes 1d4 points of fire damage + 1/2 your inquisitor level (minimum 1). If the target is currently the subject of a polymorph effect that changes its appearance (such as by&nbsp;alter self,&nbsp;shapechange, or an innate shapechanging ability such as that possessed by doppelgangers), it instead takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1/2 your inquisitor level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>"
