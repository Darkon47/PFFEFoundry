      "value": "<p>The implement allows its bearer to distort his form and location, protecting him from harm. As a standard action, the bearer can gain a concealment miss chance equal to 5% for every point of mental focus invested in the implement (to a maximum of 5% + 5% for every 2 occultist levels you possess) until the next time the bearer makes an attack. If this miss chance reaches 50%, it doesnâ€™t increase further, but the bearer gains all the benefits of&nbsp;invisibility. Creatures with&nbsp;see invisibility,&nbsp;true seeing, or similar abilities ignore the miss chance from this ability.</p>"
