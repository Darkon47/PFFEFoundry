He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>\n<p>The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style feats apply&nbsp;only&nbsp;when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>"
