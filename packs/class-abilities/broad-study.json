The magus can use his spellstrike and spell combat abilities while casting or using spells from the spell list of that class. This does not allow him to cast arcane spells from that class's spell list without suffering the normal chances of arcane spell failure, unless the spell lacks somatic components.</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 6th level and must possess levels in at least one other spellcasting class before selecting this arcana.</p>"
