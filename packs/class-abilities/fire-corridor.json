The passage is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. It is 10 feet long, plus 5 feet longer for every 3 kineticist levels you have. Any heat generated by the fire or lava through which the passage passes is radiated outwards, making the passage comfortable and safe.</p>\n<p>The passage lasts for 1 hour, though you can end the effect at any time as a free action. If this effect ends while a creature is inside the tunnel, that creature is affected by the fire or lava as normal.</p>"
