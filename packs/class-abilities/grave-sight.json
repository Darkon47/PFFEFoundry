When using this ability, she can tell whether or not creatures within 30 feet that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or dead, as well as determine if any are undead. Lastly, she can tell if those creatures are poisoned or diseased.</p>\n<p>The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
