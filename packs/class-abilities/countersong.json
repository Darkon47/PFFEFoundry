      "value": "<p>At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.) Each round of the countersong he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</p>"
