      "value": "<p>When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently blinded. A successful saving throw reduces this to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC for this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigator’s level + his Intelligence modifier. This talent has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM’s discretion). Blindness can be cured by&nbsp;heal,&nbsp;regeneration,&nbsp;remove blindness, or similar abilities.</p>\n<p>An investigator must be at least 17th level to select this talent.</p>"
