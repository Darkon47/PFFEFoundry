This takes 1 minute of concentration, during which time you must either picture this item or person if familiar to you, or meditate on the item’s or person’s description if not. Until you choose a new focus, you gain a bonus equal to half your inquisitor level on Perception checks to see or hear your focus, or when using Survival to track your focus or a creature with your focus in its possession. This bonus stacks with that gained from the track special ability.</p>"
