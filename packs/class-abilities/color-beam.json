If the beam hits, the target is blinded for 1 round if it has a number of Hit Dice equal to or lower than your occultist level.</p>\n<p>A foe with a number of Hit Dice greater than your occultist level is instead dazzled for 1 round.</p>\n<p>The foe can attempt a Will save to negate the effect.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether it succeeds at its save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting illusion effect.</p>"
