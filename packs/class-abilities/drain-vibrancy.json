Three times per day, as a standard action you can drain vibrancy within a 30-foot radius, causing the area and all creatures within it to become pale and sallow. Each living creature in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier) or take 1 temporary negative level as their life force drains away.</p>\n<p>If youâ€™re at least 17th level, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 2 temporary negative levels instead.</p>"
