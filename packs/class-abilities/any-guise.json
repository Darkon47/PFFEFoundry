Furthermore, if the actual individual wouldnâ€™t normally be able to be found via magic (such as by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead.</p>\n<p>A vigilante must be at least 17th level and have the everyman social talent to select this talent.</p>"
