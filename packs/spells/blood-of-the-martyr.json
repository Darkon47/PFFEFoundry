Any creature that takes a full-round action to sup the blood of the bleeding subject heals a number of hit points equal to twice as many as the subject lost that round due to the bleed effect. The subject must be willing or helpless to sup her blood, which provokes attacks of opportunity. Only one creature can be healed in this way per round. The subject can lick her own wounds in this way to regain half as many hit points as she lost that round. If the bleeding effect is stopped or the spell's duration ends, the subject's blood no longer heals those who drink it, though in the latter case the subject continues to bleed until the bleeding is stopped via magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check.</p>\n</div>\n"
