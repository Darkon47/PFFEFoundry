The possession otherwise functions (as possessionOA) except that the subject's soul is not present to resist. When <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i> ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as <i>resurrection</i>). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead.  Attempts to identify <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i> with a skill check incorrectly identify it as <i>resurrection</i> (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i>'s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.</p>\n</div>\n"
