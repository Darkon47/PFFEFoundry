As per <i>alarm</i>, when intruders that do not speak the password pass within 20 feet, the swarm is alerted and immediately leaves its nest and attacks the nearest intruder. The swarm pursues that intruder as best it can. Once the swarm attacks an intruder, you have no control over its target or direction of travel.
