An entangled creature receives a saving throw each round to free itself from the tar, and can also attempt to free itself by spending a move action to attempt a Strength check or Escape Artist check (DC = spell saving throw DC).  It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square in the area of effect, and the DC of Acrobatics checks within the area of effect increases by 5. The area is difficult terrain. A creature that moves into or starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must reattempt this Reflex save or become entangled. A creature that falls prone in the area takes a -4 penalty on its Reflex save against the tar and on Strength and Escape Artist checks to escape the tar.  A creature that escapes the tar still takes fire damage from the tar until the spell ends or that creature spends a full-round action removing the tar. A creature with tar on it takes a -4 penalty on Acrobatics and Fly checks made to fly with wings or similar appendages.</p>\n</div>\n"
