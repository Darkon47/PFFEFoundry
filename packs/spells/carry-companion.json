Creatures with an attitude of less than helpful will not tolerate this spell, and it automatically fails to work on them. An intelligent animal or magical beast must be a willing subject in order for this spell to take effect. Any items that the creature wears (such as a harness or saddle) or carries (such as those stowed in saddlebags) are transformed along with the creature.  While miniaturized, the creature is under an effect similar to that of a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell: It is mindless and inert, and does not seem alive when viewed with spells like <i>deathwatch</i>. However, you may return the creature to its normal form at any time simply by placing the figurine on the ground, touching it, and uttering a word of command. Otherwise, the creature remains in miniature form unless the spell is broken, such as by <i>dispel magic</i> or stronger magic. Unlike a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell, a creature affected by <i>carry companion</i> is unaffected by <i>stone to flesh</i>. If the miniature figurine is broken or damaged, the creature (if returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities.</p>\n</div>\n"
