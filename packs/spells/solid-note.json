The exact appearance of the <i>solid note</i> depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the <i>solid note</i> resists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the <i>solid note</i> simply fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.</p>\n</div>\n"
