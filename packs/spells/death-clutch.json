The creature is staggered until the beginning of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a <i>regenerate</i> spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart's regeneration, it doesn't immediately die when your next turn begins. If a creature that dies from <i>death clutch</i> is brought back from the dead by a <i>Breath of Life</i> or <i>raise dead</i> spell, it must also be targeted with <i>regenerate</i> on the following round to restore its missing heart or be unable to return to life.  A target with 201 or more hit points that fails its saving throw manages to keep its heart from leaping out of its chest, but it is still staggered for 1 minute and takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed.  Regardless of its current hit points, if the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it is still staggered until the beginning of your next turn as it feels its heart wrenching within its chest.</p>\n</div>\n"
