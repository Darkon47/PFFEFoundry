Spells, spell-like abilities, or class features that take a free, swift, or immediate action aren't affected by this spell, nor are mythic spells or mythic powers.  While under the effect of this spell, if the subject must attempt a concentration check to cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability for any reason other than the effect of this spell (such as casting defensively, being injured while casting, and so on), it takes a penalty on that check equal to 1/2 its caster level.</p>\n</div>\n"
