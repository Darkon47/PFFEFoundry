The <i>spiritual ally</i> threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The <i>spiritual ally</i> uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the <i>spiritual ally</i> hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level).
