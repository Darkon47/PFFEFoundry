Similarly, the creature is immune to poison, disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal creatures of CR 6 or lower, including  effects such as basidirond spores, violet fungus rot, and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as striped toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half your caster level. <i>Protection from Spores</i> offers no protection against fungal infestations created by the seeded, by the spell <i>what grows within</i>, or by Xhamen-Dor.</p>\n</div>\n"
