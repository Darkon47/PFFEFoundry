After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.  If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you are teleported to a random open space on a suitable surface within the range and other limitations of the spell.

On a plane with subjective directional gravity, you can use this spell to teleport in any direction.</p>\n</div>\n"
