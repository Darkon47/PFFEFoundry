Careful examination of or handling the target grants a saving throw to disbelieve, but casual observation does not. Using a broken object for its intended purpose automatically reveals the deception. Appraise checks to assess the value of an object affected by <i>quintessence</i> estimate the value as an item of its type in perfect condition, unless the appraiser disbelieves the illusion.  Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them with successful Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who interact with the target can attempt Will saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn't apply. <i>Quintessence</i> counters and dispels <i>decrepit disguise</i>.</p>\n</div>\n"
