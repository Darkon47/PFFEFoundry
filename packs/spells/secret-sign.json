As you cast the spell, you can define one auditory, olfactory, tangible, or visual criterion-such as all creatures wearing green bands on their left arms or only creatures who smell of lavender or only orcs-that allows designated creatures within 30 feet to see the <i>secret sign</i>.  Disguises and illusions that mimic the set criterion can fool this spell. Normal darkness doesn't conceal a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Auditory criteria (such as a password) and tangible criteria (such as pressing your hand against a specific object or wall) can be performed by anyone who learns of them. A <i>secret sign</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb, but can differentiate apparent races, genders, and garments. <i>See invisibility</i> and <i>invisibility purge</i> reveal the sign, but <i>glitterdust</i> does not.  A caster of at least 10th level can make <i>secret sign</i> permanent on an object with a <i>permanency</i> spell using 5,000 gp of diamond dust as a material component.</p>\n</div>\n"
