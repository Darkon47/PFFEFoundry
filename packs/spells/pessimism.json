No amount of achievement counters the spell's effects-the target simply explains away positive events with a self-critical perspective.  Certain events can solidify the character's belief that it is doomed. Whenever the target rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, fails an ability or skill check by more than 5, or takes additional damage as a result of a foe's confirmed critical hit, the penalty to roll imposed by <i>pessimism</i> becomes -3 for 1 round.
