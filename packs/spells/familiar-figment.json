This spell does not grant your familiar concealment or prevent it from being targeted by spell effects that do not require an attack roll.  In addition, as a swift action, your familiar can direct the familiar figment to attempt a melee touch attack, using your base attack bonus and the familiar's Dexterity modifier. If this attack hits, your familiar (but not other creatures) treats that target as flanked until the end of its turn.</p>\n</div>\n"
