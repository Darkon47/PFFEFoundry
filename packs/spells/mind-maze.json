The target must move at its maximum speed during this required movement, though additional move actions after the first can cover shorter distances. If this movement takes the target into a dangerous area, such as through a threatened square or off a ledge, the target receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Walking into a harmless obstacle, such as a wall, ends the target's movement.</p>\n</div>\n"
