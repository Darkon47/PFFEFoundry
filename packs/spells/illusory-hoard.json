For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure's owner without magical tools such as <i>bags of holding</i> or <i>portable holes</i>, such as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a merchant's strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache.  The material component is any item worth 10 gp or more taken from the original hoard. This item is consumed by the spell.</p>\n</div>\n"
