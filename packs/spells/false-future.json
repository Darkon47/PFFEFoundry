Instead of the target's true actions or experiences, divinations resolve as if the target will experience some different future you describe as you cast <i>false future</i>. The target creature can attempt a Will save to avoid the initial effect, and creatures using divinations get a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. This spell doesn't prevent divinations cast after the duration's end from determining what the subject actually did during the time you obscured using <i>false future</i>.  <i>False future</i> can't be detected by <i>detect magic</i> or <i>identify</i>, but greater <i>detect magic</i> (see page 212) can detect it.</p>\n</div>\n"
