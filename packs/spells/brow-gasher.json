When that penalty reaches -3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20% miss chance). When the penalty reaches -5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed damage ends the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target that is immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell's effects.</p>\n</div>\n"
