Neutral outsiders are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds. A creature can attempt a Will save to halve the damage and negate the nauseated effect.  The spell deals half damage against creatures that are chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good, and such targets are not nauseated. On a successful Will save, such a creature reduces the damage to one-quarter the damage rolled.</p>\n</div>\n"
