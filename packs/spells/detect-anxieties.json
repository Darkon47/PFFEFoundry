If the highest Wisdom score is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Wisdom score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.  Instead of surface thoughts, the third round of concentration reveals the most pressing current anxiety of any mind in the area (Will negates).  Presenting a creature with the threat of its anxiety grants you a +2 bonus (or higher, at the GM's discretion) on checks to Intimidate that creature.</p>\n</div>\n"
