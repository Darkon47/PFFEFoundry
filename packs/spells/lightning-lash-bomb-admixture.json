If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and those of the new one become active.  When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, lashes of electrical energy are released from the bomb, coalescing on the bomb's direct target and up to three creatures that take damage from the bomb's splash (alchemist's choice).
