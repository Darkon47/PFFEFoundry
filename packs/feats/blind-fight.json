That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while blinded.</p></p>\n                \n            <br />\n                <p><b>Normal</b></p>\n                <p><p class=\"stat-block-1\"> Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.
