If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a &ndash;2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.</p></p>\n                \n            \n            "
