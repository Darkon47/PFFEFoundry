          "value": "<h1>Class Features</h1>\n<h2>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bravery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Armor Training</strong>: Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor’s check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Armor-Training\">Advanced Armor Training</a>&nbsp;below) . If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th*, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>\n<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Training</strong>: Beginning at 9th level, instead of selecting an additional fighter weapon group, a fighter can choose an advanced weapon training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Weapon-Training\">Advanced Weapon Training</a>&nbsp;below) for one fighter weapon group that he previously selected with the weapon training class feature.&nbsp;Source:&nbsp;<a

gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Armor Training</h2>\n<p>Highly skilled and tenacious fighters can gain advanced armor training, learning techniques and applications of the armor training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for reducing their ability to mitigate their armor’s armor check penalty and improve its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus.</p>\n<p>Advanced armor training options function only when the fighter is wearing appropriate armor or using a shield, unless otherwise noted. A fighter with an archetype that replaces armor training cannot select advanced armor training options.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Adaptable Training (Ex)</strong>: The fighter can use his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;in place of his ranks in one skill of his choice from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb\">Climb</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(engineering),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a>&nbsp;(soldier),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\">Ride</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim\">Swim</a>. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;(including his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Specialization (Ex)</strong>: The fighter selects one specific type of armor with which he is proficient, such as chain shirts or scale mail. While wearing the selected type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, +4 for medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>&nbsp;doesn’t increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor’s base&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>, including other advanced armor training options. A fighter can choose this option multiple times. Each time he chooses it, he applies its benefit to a different type of armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Armored Confidence (Ex)</strong>: While wearing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the fighter gains a bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;checks based upon the type of armor he is wearing: +1 for light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, +2 for medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or +3 for heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +4 at 19th level.

Once the skills have been selected, they cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his skill ranks in the selected skills at no additional cost in money or time.

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a> with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> creature takes a -2 penalty on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a> and a -4 penalty to <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a> and must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>\r\n<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a> check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of <a class=\"magic-item\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/universal-solvent\">universal solvent</a> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>\r\n<p class=\"header\">Alchemical Power Component</p>\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <a title=\"PZO9410\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601252226/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601252226&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO9410</a></p>\r\n<p>Tanglefoot bags can make troublesome spells even worse when used as a power component.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/black-tentacles\">Black Tentacles</a> (M): For each tanglefoot bag used as a power component, you may reroll the tentacles' <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a> check against one creature of your choice.</li>\r\n<li><a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow\">Slow</a> (M): For each tangelefoot bag used as a power component, you may designate one slowed creature as being affected by a tanglefoot bag.</li>\r\n<li><a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/web\">Web</a> (M): Increase the DC of breaking free by making a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a> or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a> check by 1.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

This <i>darkness</i> causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to <i>darkness</i>. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or <i>darkness</i> without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of <i>darkness</i>. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>If <i>darkness</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.</p><p>This spell does not stack with itself. <i>Darkness</i> can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>",
