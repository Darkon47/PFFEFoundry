In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power—this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the effects to the creator.<br><br>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the Craft (alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using&nbsp;detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.<br><br>An alchemist can create three special types of magical items—extracts, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.<br><br>Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic}&nbsp;using the alchemist’s level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though, extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a potion normally could not.<br><br>An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table 2–1. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.<br><br>When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use (but see the “infusion” discovery below). An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work—most alchemists prepare many extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but it’s not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so that he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.<br><br>Although the alchemist doesn’t actually cast spells, he does have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Class=Alchemist\">formulae list</a>&nbsp;that determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formuale list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses Use Magic Device to do so). An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a potion—the effects of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist. An alchemist can draw and drink an extract as a standard action. The alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level.<br><br>Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement).<br><br>An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.<br><br>An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book.

The tumor acts as the alchemist’s familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the @Compendium[pf1.feats.Q1cY8r0Pvb66pMG0]{Alertness}&nbsp;feat, and so on). When attached to the alchemist, the tumor has fast healing 5. An alchemist’s extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level.

Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Gunslinger Deeds:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Deadeye (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm’s first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the –2 penalty on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.</p>\n<p><em>Gunslinger’s Dodge (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a> to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>\n<p><em>Quick Clear (Ex):</em> At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the gunslinger can remove the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Gunslinger Initiative (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks. Furthermore, if she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw-combat\">Quick Draw</a>&nbsp;feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;check.</p>\n<p><em>Pistol-Whip (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger’s size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/×2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check to knock the target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p>\n<p><em>Utility Shot (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blast Lock:</em> The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">Arcane lock</a>&nbsp;grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/knock\">knock</a>&nbsp;can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">arcane lock</a>&nbsp;can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>\n<li><em>Scoot Unattended Object: </em>The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot’s origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li>\n<li><em>Stop Bleeding: </em>The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Dead Shot (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;as she can, based on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>. She makes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;hit the target, the gunslinger’s single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;–5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>\n<p><em>Startling Shot (Ex): </em>At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>&nbsp;until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p><em>Targeting (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are immune to these effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Arms:</em> On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger’s choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li>\n<li><em>Head:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused\">confused</a>&nbsp;for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Legs:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;attacks are immune to this effect.</li>\n<li><em>Torso:</em> Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19–20.</li>\n<li><em>Wings:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a>&nbsp;check or fall 20 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Bleeding Wound (Ex):</em> At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;to have that attack deal extra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage. The amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage is equal to the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage (gunslinger’s choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are also immune to these types of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage.</p>\n<p><em>Expert Loading (Ex): </em>At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition.</p>\n<p><em>Lightning Reload (Ex): </em>At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;once per round. If she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rapid-reload-combat\">Rapid Reload</a>&nbsp;feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Evasive (Ex): </em>At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogue</a>&nbsp;class features.

The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Slinger’s Luck (Ex):</em> At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed’s cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.</p>\n<p><em>Cheat Death (Ex): </em>At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.</p>\n<p><em>Death’s Shot (Ex):</em> At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;or making a killing blow.</p>\n<p><em>Stunning Shot (Ex):</em> At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stun</a>&nbsp;the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier).

Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user’s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities.

This bond can take one of two forms: a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;bonded object. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a&nbsp;bonded object&nbsp;is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\" rel=\"nofollow\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>\n<p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-School\">arcane school</a>&nbsp;below).</p>\n<p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats</a> and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see @Compendium[pf1.feats.4hNO4OAWYF5vXphH]{Craft Magic Arms and Armor}&nbsp;feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.</p>\n<p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":0,"overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["Wizard"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/ore-green.jpg"}

{"_id":"z4NJaCcj9VZpBv7d","name":"Divine Bond","permission":{"default":0,"kxj1AdlhCR0Bl1uR":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Brilliant-Energy\">brilliant energy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Defending\">defending</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption/\">disruption</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming-Burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Holy\">holy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Merciful\">merciful</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Speed\">speed</a>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s cost (see&nbsp;Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>\n<p>The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin), although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable. This mount functions as a druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>, using the paladin’s level as her effective druid level.

This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin’s level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the mount gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/celestial-creature-cr-special\">celestial creature simple template</a>&nbsp;and becomes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast\">magical beast</a>&nbsp;for the purposes of determining which spells affect it.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, a paladin’s mount gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to the paladin’s level + 11.</p>\n<p>Should the paladin’s mount die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first.
