      "value": "<p>Becoming a spiritualist is not a calling—it’s a phenomenon.</p>\n<p>When a creature dies, its spirit flees its body and begins the next stage of its existence. Debilitating emotional attachments during life and other psychic corruptions cause some spirits to drift into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane\">Ethereal Plane</a>&nbsp;and descend toward the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Negative-Energy-Plane\">Negative Energy Plane</a>. Some of these spirits are able to escape the pull of undeath and make their way back to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1\">Material Plane</a>, seeking refuge in a psychically attuned mind. Such a fusing of consciousnesses creates a spiritualist—the master of a single powerful phantom whom the spiritualist can manifest to do her bidding.</p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> The spiritualist seeks the occult and esoteric truth about life, death, and the passage beyond, using her phantom as a guide and tool. The connection with her phantom allows her to harness the powers of life and death, thought and nightmare, shadow and revelation.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp.)
