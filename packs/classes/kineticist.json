      "value": "<p>Kineticists are living channels for elemental matter and energy, manipulating the world around them by drawing upon inner reserves from their own bodies. Kineticists often awaken to their kinetic abilities during a violent or traumatic experience, releasing their power involuntarily. As kinetic power is seldom inherited, kineticists are rarely able to find mentors to guide them, so they must delve into these mysteries on their own to learn to control their gifts.</p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Kineticists generally use their powers to assail their foes from range, but based on the way their talents develop, they can channel their kinetic abilities for a variety of situations. Kineticists are usually quite different from their families and friends, so they often strike out on their own or alongside others with extraordinary talents.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 1d6 × 10 gp (average 35 gp.)
