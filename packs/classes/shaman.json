      "value": "<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the influence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren’t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<p><strong>Parent Classes</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">Oracle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witch</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.)
