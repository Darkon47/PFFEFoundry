      "value": "<p>For some heroes, the rage that lives within them can’t be contained. Whether this fury is a product of heritage or of nature, these adventurers have learned to harness it, turning its power against their foes. The primal warriors known as barbarians transform their rage into a potent weapon on a battlefield. Heedless of their wounds and possessed of unstoppable bloodlust, these savage brutes are the embodiment of war.</p>\n<p><strong>Unchained:</strong> The unchained barbarian is similar in many regards to its counterpart in the Core Rulebook—she still goes into a rage and gains rage powers, but many of the details have been changed. Rage now grants temporary hit points and static bonuses on attack and damage rolls, rather than bonuses to ability scores that force players to recalculate a number of statistics. Additionally, many rage powers now function whenever the barbarian is raging, as opposed to just once per rage. Finally, the overall utility of many of the rage powers has been adjusted to make them more useful and interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any nonlawful.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d12.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Class_Skills\">Class Skills</span></h2>\n<p>The barbarian’s class skills are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dex</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Climb</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Str</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\" rel=\"nofollow\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Handle Animal</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cha</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cha</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perception</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wis</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ride</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dex</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\" rel=\"nofollow\">Survival</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wis</a>), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swim</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Str</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Ranks Per Level</strong>: 4 +&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>"
